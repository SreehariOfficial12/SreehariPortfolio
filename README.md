Hi Devcom team members,

My name is Sreehari I am first year student in Mechanical department at IIT Bombay . This is a portfolio website that uses html css javascript and some required 
libraries like bootstrap for aesthetics and lightbox for interactivity . 

How this much interactivy ?

I found a template from internet that contains basic html css and javascript and other necessary files and made so many changes .


Why template why not write everything form scratch ?

I am thinking that writing everything from scratch is not a good idea one problem is the timeline we had exactly only around 10 days i.e 16th january 2024 to 25 january 2024 and other problem is if i am writing the code again again from scratch it wastes so much time . 

Even Though it is template you have to understand it to change it I understood what it contains then only i made changes this include making

1.Three more pages
2.Changing images and their sizes
3.Adding css to three hobbie pages
4.Including email service that is when user clicks the sumbit button an email is recieved I did this using email.js library i added it totally it is not there before 
5.Changing required tags and text accordingly.
6.Including required hyperlinks


Thats what i want to tell . When making this project i ran into so many error I solved them one by one and now the website is finally here.

Hope you like it.

Made with love by sreehari to join devcom iit bombay team.
